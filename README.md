## 🚀 About me
I build automation that saves people time and interfaces that make complex systems feel sleek and simple. I enjoy blending practical backend automation (Python, Power Automate, Azure) with polished frontend experiences (React, Three.js, Framer Motion). I recently graduated with a Master of IT from QUT and worked on real industry projects including payroll automation and legal-email processing for government.

## ⚡ Fun bit
I love making small visual flourishes — neon gradients, subtle 3D parallax and smooth morphing transitions. If it looks like the future, I’m probably into it.
